Sorceries:Soul Arrow:30:1:10:0:Fires a magical projectile. Excellent starting spell which does very good damage against most enemies in the early game areas.:Griggs of Vinheim 1,000 souls Big Hat Logan 1,000 souls Blacksmith Rickert of Vinheim  2,000 souls:Ranged Magic Attack
Sorceries:Great Soul Arrow:20:1:14:0:Stronger soul arrow, same cast time as soul arrow, fewer uses.:Griggs of Vinheim 6,000 souls Big Hat Logan 6,000 souls:Ranged Magic Attack

Sorceries:Homing Soulmass:10:1:18:0:Fires multiple, homing magic projectiles. Can be successfully cast without an initial "lock on". Multiple soul arrows will hover above the player. Each individual soul arrow will seek the closest target, in the direction the player is facing, when in range. Because the spell can be cast in advance, it has a unique advantage in that, if timed correctly, it can be cast in synchronicity with other attacks.:Big Hat Logan 20,000 souls Griggs of Vinheim 20,000 souls:Ranged Magic Attack

Sorceries:White Dragon Breath:20:1:50:0:A straight line of crystals pop out of the ground in front of you, shooting towards your target. One advantage of this spell is that it will take out large groups of enemies if they are lined up one behind the other.
